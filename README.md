Script Overview
This script is a website vulnerability scanner that checks for common security vulnerabilities such as:

Known Vulnerabilities in JavaScript Libraries: It uses the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API to check if any JavaScript libraries used by the website have known vulnerabilities.

SQL Injection (SQLi): It tests forms on the website for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): It tests input fields for XSS vulnerabilities using a list of payloads.

Remote Command Execution (RCE): It tests for RCE vulnerabilities using a list of payloads.

After scanning, the script generates a Word document report summarizing the vulnerabilities found.

What the User Gains
By running this script, the user will:

Identify Security Vulnerabilities: Detect potential security issues in a website, such as SQLi, XSS, and RCE.

Understand Risks: Get detailed information about vulnerabilities, including their descriptions and severity.

Generate a Report: Receive a professional Word document report that can be shared with stakeholders or used for further analysis.

Improve Website Security: Use the findings to patch vulnerabilities and enhance the security of the website.

Dependencies
The script requires the following Python libraries:

requests: For making HTTP requests to the NIST API and the target website.

bs4 (BeautifulSoup): For parsing HTML content of the website.

python-docx: For generating the Word document report.

urllib: For URL parsing and joining.

collections: For using defaultdict to store vulnerabilities.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-docx
How to Use the Script
Save the Script:

Save the script to a file, e.g., vulnerability_scanner.py.

Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy
python vulnerability_scanner.py
Input the Target Domain:

When prompted, enter the domain or URL of the website you want to scan. For example:

Copy
Enter the domain you want to target: https://example.com
Wait for the Scan to Complete:

The script will:

Fetch CVE data from the NIST API.

Scan the website for vulnerabilities.

Generate a report.

View the Report:

The report will be saved in the Downloads directory on your computer.

The file name will be based on the target domain, e.g., example.com_report.docx.

How It Works
Fetch CVE Data:

The script fetches CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data from the NIST API and stores it in a dictionary (cve_db).

Fetch Payloads:

It downloads payloads for XSS and RCE from the PayloadsAllTheThings GitHub repository.

Scan the Website:

The script scans the website for:

Vulnerable JavaScript libraries by checking <script> tags.

SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing forms.

XSS vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into input fields.

RCE vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into forms.

Generate a Report:

The script creates a Word document report summarizing the vulnerabilities found.

Example Output
Word Document Report:
Copy
Vulnerability Report for https://example.com

CVE-2023-1234
- Description: A vulnerability in jQuery 3.6.0 allows XSS attacks.
- Library: jquery.js
- Version: 9.8

SQLi
- URL: https://example.com/login
- Parameter: username
- Description: SQL injection vulnerability detected

XSS
- URL: https://example.com/search
- Parameter: query
- Description: Cross-site scripting vulnerability detected

RCE
- URL: https://example.com/upload
- Parameter: cmd
- Description: Remote Command Execution vulnerability detected
Limitations
Rate Limits: The NIST API has rate limits. If you exceed them, you may need to wait or use an API key.

False Positives: The script may report false positives, especially for SQLi and RCE vulnerabilities.

Limited Scope: It only checks for specific vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, RCE) and does not cover all possible security issues.

Ethical Use: Only use this script on websites you own or have permission to test. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

Customization
You can customize the script to:

Add more vulnerability checks (e.g., CSRF, file inclusion).

Use a local file for CVE data instead of the NIST API.

Modify the payloads or add new ones.

Change the report format (e.g., PDF, HTML).
